        Do you consider yourself an animal lover? Are you vegan? If you answered
        no to the last question, then you <span> do not </span> love animals.
        Animals need our help now more than ever. Choosing to not consume animal
        products is not only the ethical choice but the healthiest choice you
        can make for yourself. According to one estimate, 200 million land
        animals are slaughtered around the world every single day. That's 72
        billion a year. In the United States alone, roughly 25 million animals
        are slaughtered every single day. Ethical meat is a lie. It's tempting
        to want to believe that the meat you eat is ethical, that the animals
        have lived full, happy lives and that they have experienced no pain or
        fear at the slaughterhouse. Yet the sad truth is that all living
        creatures (even those labelled 'free range' or 'organic') fear death,
        just as we do. No matter how they are treated when alive, they all
        experience the same fear when it comes to slaughter.

          Research
        </a>
        has shown that regularly eating meat and processed meat can raise the
        risk of type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke and certain
        cancers, especially colorectal cancer. Vegan diets are healthful,
        nutritionally adequate, and provide health benefits in the prevention
        and treatment of certain diseases. According to one
        <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1552366/" target="_blank">
          study,
        </a>
        "vegan diets are effective in treating and preventing several chronic
        diseases." The adaptation of a low-fat vegan diet can substantially
        mitigate the impacts of type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and
        Parkinson's disease. Veganism reduces the risk of colon cancer. Eating
        vegan is finally becoming about what you can eat,
        <strong> not what you can't. </strong> Whether you choose to give
        veganism a try for your health, the environment, or the animals, you'll
        be creating an impact that stems far beyond yourself. Click the button
